      <p>
        Summarizz is committed to making our application accessible to all
        users, including those with disabilities. We understand the importance
        of providing an inclusive experience and are continuously working to
        improve the accessibility of our platform. However, at this time, some
        accessibility features are still under development.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Accessibility Status</h2>

      <p>
        Currently, Summarizz has limited accessibility features. We acknowledge
        that this may create challenges for some users. We are actively planning
        and developing the following accessibility enhancements:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Text-to-Voice Feature:</strong> We are developing a
          text-to-voice feature to provide audio output of content, making it
          easier for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties to
          access information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Display Preference/Customization:</strong> We are working on
          providing users with options to customize display settings, such as
          font size, color contrast, and layout, to accommodate various visual
          needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> We are aiming to improve
          keyboard navigation throughout the application to make it more usable
          for users who rely on keyboard input.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Screen Reader Compatibility:</strong> We are working to
          improve compatibility with screen reader software, ensuring that users
          can effectively navigate and interact with the application.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>

        We are dedicated to making Summarizz more accessible and are committed

        evaluate and improve our application to meet the needs of all users.
      </p>
