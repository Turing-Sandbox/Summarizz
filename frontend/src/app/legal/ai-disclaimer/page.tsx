      <h1>AI Disclaimer</h1>

        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 25, 2025
      </p>

      <p>
        Summarizz utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to provide certain
        features, including content summarization and thumbnail generation.
        Please read this disclaimer carefully to understand the limitations and
        implications of AI-generated content within our App.
      </p>

      <h2>1. AI-Generated Summaries</h2>

      <p>
        Summarizz employs AI algorithms to generate summaries of content
        articles. While we strive to ensure the accuracy and relevance of these
        summaries, AI-generated content may not always perfectly reflect the
        original source material. Therefore:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy:</strong> AI-generated summaries are provided for
          convenience and informational purposes only. They should not be
          considered a substitute for reading the full original article.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bias:</strong> AI models can sometimes reflect biases present
          in the data they were trained on. Summaries may inadvertently include
          or omit information, potentially leading to biased or incomplete
          representations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The AI's interpretation of the source
          material may differ from human understanding. Critical analysis and
          independent verification are recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Changes:</strong> The algorithms and models are continuously
          being improved, thus the results may change over time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. AI-Generated Thumbnails</h2>

      <p>
        Summarizz plans to use AI to generate thumbnails for content. These
        thumbnails are intended to provide visual representations of the
        content. However:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Relevance:</strong> While AI will attempt to create relevant
          thumbnails, the generated images may not always perfectly represent
          the content or its context.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aesthetic:</strong> The aesthetic quality and style of
          AI-generated thumbnails may vary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Originality:</strong> The created thumbnails may not be wholly
          original, and could contain elements similar to images used in the AI
          training data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Liability:</strong> We are not responsible for any
          misinterpretations or offense caused by the generated thumbnails.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>

      <p>
        Users are responsible for evaluating the accuracy and appropriateness of
        AI-generated content and thumbnails. You should exercise your own
        judgment and discretion when using the App and its features.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>

      <p>
        Summarizz and its creators are not liable for any errors, inaccuracies,
        or omissions in AI-generated content or thumbnails. We are not
        responsible for any damages or losses arising from your reliance on
        AI-generated content.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Continuous Improvement</h2>

      <p>
        We are continuously working to improve the accuracy and reliability of
        our AI models. However, AI technology is still evolving, and its
        limitations should be acknowledged.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Feedback</h2>

      <p>
        We welcome user feedback on AI-generated content and thumbnails. Your
        feedback helps us improve our services. Please contact us through our
        contact page with any comments or suggestions.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to this AI Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>
        We may update this AI Disclaimer from time to time to reflect changes in
        our AI technologies or for other operational, legal, or regulatory
        reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use
